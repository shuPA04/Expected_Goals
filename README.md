# Expected Goals
Expected goals (ExG) is a tactical metric that calculates the probablity of shots being scored based on a variety of characteristics of the shots, such as shot location or foot type. In this project, I have built a logistic regression model to predict ExG from La liga 2004/05 to 2019/20 seasons.
